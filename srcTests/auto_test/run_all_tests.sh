> This script will automatically compile GITM and
  run the test cases located within srcTests/auto_test/
  - All UAM files matching the pattern UAM.*.test
    are automatically tested on GitHub

> When adding a new feature, it is recommended to create a test. 
  - To do this, first create a UAM.in file which uses the new feature.
  - Then, run this script with: 
    > ./run_all_tests.sh -d -c --save_solution -o [your uam file]
  - Add a few words to the file name to explain the test. See below for more.
  - Please try to keep the numbers increasing sequentially, if possible.

Additional notes about the test may be added. Name must conform to: 
            UAM.in.##.*.test
and no spaces can be added. Numbers do not need to be increasing, but will be useful 
when comparing outputs. It is recommended to follow the pattern:
            UAM.in.##.[anything_you_want].test

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
------

> First, from root of repository, install GITM with './Config.pl [...]'
> Next, 'cd srcTests/auto_test/'

- To just check that the code compiles and all tests run, use:
    > ./run_all_tests.sh

- If a test fails and you have made edits, you don't need to re-run every test.
  (substitute for another test):
    > ./run_all_tests.sh --only UAM.in.00.default.test

- For a sanity check, you can force the code to be re-compiled with the (-c/--clean) 
  flag:
    > ./run_all_tests.sh -c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arguments:
----------

        [none]                    run automatically with defaults.
        -h, --help                see this information
        -c, --clean               Run a 'make clean' before make-ing?
        -u, --uninstall           Force a 'make distclean' before running?
                                    This effectively uninstalls GITM before running. 
                                    Useful when dependencies change, or when a lot of
                                    changes have been made (by you or git). 
                                    * Will only work with gfortran10 & in debug mode. *
        -o, --only                Only run this UAM test file.
                                    Useful if a higher number test has failed.
                                    By default, all tests are run alphabetically.
        --nocompare               Default configuration diff's the log file.
                                    Use this if you want to only do a run & not
                                    check the output.
        --save_solution           Rewrite (or create) reference solution?
                                    - Similar to the SWMF's '-BLESS'.
                                    - Will take a moment to rewrite a solution in case
                                      this is set erroreously.
                                    - If a test was overwritten by mistake, use
                                      'git restore' to put it back.
        --oversubscribe           Run 'mpirun' with the '--oversubscribe' flag?
                                    This is necessary on GitHub's CI/CD servers, but
                                    is not be necessary for *most* users. As some MPI
                                    libraries implement this differently, this is
                                    off by default.
