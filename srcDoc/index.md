# Introduction

Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model

## Welcome

Hi. Thanks for visiting this website. Here is some info on how to use GITM.

Please see the [quick start](quick_start.md) page for more info on how to
download, configure, and install GITM.

## Notes for Developers

Some notes on the doc site:

- See the [markdown style guide](markdown_ref.md) for info on what features are
  available.
- The documentation, presently, looks in `srcDoc/` for any markdown files and
  adds them to this site alphabetically. This can be changed later, but filling
  the docs out initially will be easier if pages are automatically added.
